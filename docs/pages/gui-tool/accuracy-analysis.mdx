# Accuracy Analysis

Analyze accuracy of inaccurate adder/inaccurate multiplier by comparing it with accurate adder/accurate multiplier using two user provided unsigned numbers

## Adder Accuracy Analysis

![Accuracy Analysis](/_images/gui_tool/accuracy_analysis.png)

1. Type of Accuracy Analysis to carry out, choose one of `[Adder Accuracy Analysis, Multiplier Accuracy Analysis]`

   - Default Options: `Adder Accuracy Analysis`

2. Total number of bits for approximate computing module

   - Default Options: `4`
   - Constraints: `4 <= total_bits <= 32`

3. Accurate bits and Inaccurate bits selection. Move slider to adjust.

   - Default Options: `acc_bits = 1` `inacc_bits = 3`
   - Constraints: `3 <= inacc_bits <= total_bits - 1`

4. Two unsigned decimal numbers to be added using accurate adder and to be compared against inaccurate adder for accuracy

   - Default Options: `12`
   - Constraints: `0 <= decimal_number <= 2^(total_bits) -1`

5. Type of hardware module to analyse error, chose one of `[HEAA, HOERAA, HOAANED, M-HERLOA]`

   - Default Options: `HEAA`

6. Start Analysing Accuracy

## Multiplier Accuracy Analysis

1. Total Multiplicand bits and Total Multiplier bits

   - Default Options: `4`
   - Constraints: `multiplicand_bits >= 3`and `multiplier_bits >=3`

2. V-cut

   - Default Options: `3`
   - Constraints: `0 <= v_cut <= multiplicand_bits`

3. Two unsigned decimal numbers to be multiplied using accurate multiplier and compared against MxN AAM01 with V-cut for accuracy

   - Default Options: `12`
   - Constraints: `0 <= decimal_number <= 2^(multiplicand_bits) -1` and `0 <= decimal_number <= 2^(multiplier_bits) -1`

4. Type of hardware module to analyse accuracy

   - Default Options: `MxN AAM01 with V=cut`

5. Start Analysing Accuracy
