# What it is

GUI and Command Line Tool that have 3 features:

1. [Verilog Code Generator](/gui-tool/verilog-code-generator)

Generate verilog code (.v file) of inaccurate adder or inaccurate multiplier based on user chosen options

2. [Error Analyzers](/gui-tool/error-analysis)

Analyze error rates of inaccurate adder/inaccurate multiplier by comparing it with accurate adder/accurate multiplier using 1 million monte carlo random sampled unsigned numbers

3. [Accuracy Analzyer](/gui-tool/accuracy-analysis)

Analyze accuracy of inaccurate adder/inaccurate multiplier by comparing it with accurate adder/accurate multiplier using two user provided unsigned numbers
